This is the web application that will be used to schedule
and monitor usage of all BrisSynBio equipment

This is being built to be run from and use the resources

The local_client_secrets.py contains sensitive password
and user account data that MUST NOT be uploaded to a 
publicly visible server.

To deploy an update to this software type

appcfg.py --oauth2 update .

This will upload the application so that it is available
at the address

================

To push / pull to google git you need to authenticate with gcloud, e.g.

gcloud auth login

(this will log you in via a browser)

then ensure that you set the gcloud.sh as an authenticator for git, e.g.

git config credential.helper gcloud.sh

Then git pull and git push should work
